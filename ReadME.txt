Hi Ruairi.
To set this up I used Apache server on xampp.
I stored this folder in my htdocs.
I then looked up http://localhost/A2_COMP8054_Downey_Feargal_R00202629./pokemon_charts.html


In order to use the visualisation You can select any 6 pokemon to add from the dropdown.
You can remove any individual pokemon from your team or remove the whole lot by either clicking Remove or clear team.

By hovering over the bars you will see a tooltip of more details about the pokemon such as their name, their types and their actual stat value.

Thanks for everything.

Feargal.
